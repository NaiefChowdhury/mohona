<h1 style="text-align: center;"> A Winter Morning </h1>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
A winter morning has its own exceptional natural aspects as well as its effects on human life. A winter morning is misty and cold. There is dense fog everywhere. Sometimes, the fog is so dense that the sunrays cannot get through it. Everything looks hazy. The scenery of a winter morning is really charming in rural areas. Dewdrops on grass and leaves sparkle like pearls in the sunrays. Generally, people wake up late in the morning. They shiver in cold. They wear warm clothes. Old people and children are found basking in the morning sun. People usually have date juice and various native 'pithas' as breakfast. Cattle remain in their sheds. However, in cities, a a winter morning does not make much change in life as it is is not too cold there. People wake up at their usual time, wear colorful warm clothes and go to their work place. Students are seen in the most colorful warm clothes. The nature is dull and gloomy here, too. Both in rural and urban areas, poor people are the worst sufferers. They don't have enough warm clothes to protect themselves from the biting cold. Street children gather straw and papers and make fire to war themselves. The communication system is disrupted, which causes much hardship to the people. However, the scenery of a winter morning is very transitory. It starts disappering as the day advances. My personal feeling about a winter morning is that it is a bane for the poor, but a boon for the rich.
